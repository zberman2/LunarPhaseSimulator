# LunarPhaseSimulator
ASTR 390 Independent Study

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/RaKNXy.

 Github repo : https://github.com/juliangarnier/3D-CSS-Solar-System
Works better in webkit, buggy in FF, flat in IE.
Inspired by http://neography.com/experiment/circles/solarsystem/ and http://nicolasgallagher.com/css-pseudo-element-solar-system/demo/
[update] Added some basic responsive styles


Forked from [Julian Garnier](http://codepen.io/juliangarnier/)'s Pen [CSS 3D Solar System](http://codepen.io/juliangarnier/pen/idhuG/).

TODO:

Track the moon in its orbit (idea: use clock (animation time -> lunar phase))

Shade the moon (half illuminated)

Button for start/stop animation
